# ADR-001: Agent Architecture Design

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Decision Makers:** Architecture Team  
**Technical Story:** Multi-Agent Marketing System Design

## Context

We need to design a collaborative multi-agent system for marketing automation that can:
- Handle lead triage and categorization
- Manage personalized customer engagement
- Optimize campaign performance autonomously
- Scale to handle thousands of concurrent conversations
- Learn and adapt from interactions over time

## Decision

We will implement a **3-agent collaborative architecture** with specialized responsibilities:

### Agent Types

1. **Lead Triage Agent**
   - Single instance, centralized triage
   - Categorizes all incoming leads
   - Assigns leads to appropriate engagement agents
   - Uses rule-based + ML scoring

2. **Engagement Agent** (Multiple Instances)
   - Horizontally scalable (multiple instances)
   - Manages personalized outreach per lead
   - Executes multi-channel campaigns
   - Handles conversation state

3. **Campaign Optimization Agent**
   - Single instance, system-wide optimization
   - Monitors campaign performance metrics
   - Adjusts strategies based on data
   - Escalates critical issues to managers

### Agent Communication Pattern

- **Message-Based Communication:** Asynchronous message passing via MCP protocol
- **Handoff Protocol:** Context-preserving handoffs between agents
- **Escalation Path:** Critical issues escalated to human managers

### Base Agent Framework

All agents inherit from `BaseAgent` abstract class providing:
- Lifecycle management (initialize, start, stop)
- Message queue processing
- MCP client integration
- Memory system access
- Action logging and metrics

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Separation of Concerns:** Each agent has clear, focused responsibility
- **Scalability:** Engagement agents can scale horizontally
- **Maintainability:** Easier to update individual agent logic
- **Testability:** Agents can be tested independently
- **Resilience:** Failure of one agent type doesn't cascade

### Negative

- **Complexity:** More components to orchestrate
- **Network Overhead:** Inter-agent communication adds latency
- **State Synchronization:** Must ensure consistency across agents
- **Debugging:** Distributed system debugging is harder

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Comprehensive Logging:** Correlation IDs for request tracing
2. **Health Checks:** Regular agent health monitoring
3. **Circuit Breakers:** Prevent cascade failures
4. **Message Replay:** Enable recovery from failures
5. **Observability:** Metrics and monitoring dashboards

## Alternatives Considered

### Monolithic Single Agent
- **Rejected:** Not scalable, single point of failure

### Microservices per Function
- **Rejected:** Too granular, excessive network overhead

### Event Sourcing Architecture
- **Considered:** Good for audit trail but adds complexity

## Implementation Notes

```python
# Agent instantiation example
lead_triage = LeadTriageAgent(
    agent_id="LT-001",
    mcp_client=mcp_client,
    memory_manager=memory_manager
)

engagement_pool = [
    EngagementAgent(
        agent_id=f"EN-{i:03d}",
        mcp_client=mcp_client,
        memory_manager=memory_manager
    )
    for i in range(1, 11)  # 10 engagement agents
]

campaign_optimizer = CampaignOptimizationAgent(
    agent_id="CO-001",
    mcp_client=mcp_client,
    memory_manager=memory_manager
)
```
